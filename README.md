# JapaneseThing
<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>This is a incomplete project that was created as a means to use C#, determine how to use japanese text in a console window, and to help me study japanese for my japanese class.</p>
<p>The original idea was to be able to save questions in a separate file and load them into this program so that you could test yourself on what you needed specifically.</p>
<p>The project was abandoned due to my lack of knowledge of the japanese language and my inability to verify that any of the question and answers were correct or good.</p>

<h1>What I learned</h1>
<p>Besides more basic japanese, I learned a bit more about the C# language such as writing to the console window, setting it up to display unicode, and using the ArrayList/Vector equivalent class in C#.</p>
